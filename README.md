### **AI-Powered Blood Cell Detection Web App**  

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered web application for detecting and classifying blood cells using a fine-tuned YOLOv10 object detection model. The **BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection) dataset** is used to train the model, which consists of annotated images containing **Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), and Platelets**. The objective is to create a seamless **interactive web application using Streamlit** that allows users to upload blood smear images and receive real-time predictions with bounding boxes and confidence scores.  

The model was fine-tuned on Google Colab using **YOLOv10**, leveraging **data augmentation techniques** such as rotation, cropping, and flipping to improve detection accuracy. The training process was optimized to maximize **precision and recall** for each blood cell class. After training, the model was exported and integrated into a **Streamlit-based web interface**, enabling easy interaction. The app provides an intuitive experience, allowing users to upload an image, visualize the **detected blood cells with bounding boxes**, and view a **performance table displaying precision and recall metrics** for each class.  

To ensure accessibility, the web application is **deployed on Hugging Face Spaces**, making it available for public use without requiring any local installations. The app is designed with **efficient backend processing** for smooth performance, ensuring that users receive quick and accurate detection results. Additionally, to enhance creativity, features such as **multiple class predictions, precision-recall tables, and an improved UI design** have been incorporated.  

This project demonstrates a complete **AI pipeline**, covering model training, inference, web development, and deployment. It showcases the potential of **computer vision in medical applications**, providing a practical and scalable solution for automated blood cell analysis.
